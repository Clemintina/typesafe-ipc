# `typesafe-ipc` Example App

A minimal and framework-agnostic electron application to showcase `typesafe-ipc` in action.

Like all electron apps this one has code for the main process ([`main.ts`](./src/main.ts)) and the renderer process ([`renderer.ts`](./src/renderer.ts)) that sometimes need to exchange messages.
